Things TODO:

>Agent:
- How to specify the net and preprocessing in Tensorforce?
- Maybe I can prepare the policy network with my own class,
	creating a bridge with Tensorforce networks.
- Preprocessing: see at the original paper
- Train a good breakout agent on breakout
- Use Dueling DQN

>Features:
- predict function to how the features work
- Batch, instance normalization?
- improve initizazion

Things done:
- Simple autoencoder
- Crop the game board to the relevant part
- Tensorforce for DQN
- Trained features and agent on server
- Player.play()
- Decaying exploration rate
- collect training samples during reinforcement learning

Notes:
- In breakout, rewards are given at each brocken brick
