Things TODO:

- Flake8
- Check locked and add pipfile.lock

>Agent:
- Test new Trainer on server
- Train an agent on breakout
- Try with different batch and update frequency.
	Is exploration needed?

>Features:
- predict function to how the features work
- Batch, instance normalization?
- improve initizazion

Things done:
- Simple autoencoder
- Crop the game board to the relevant part
- Tensorforce for DQN
- Trained features and agent on server
- Player.play()
- Decaying exploration rate
- collect training samples during reinforcement learning

Notes:
- In breakout, rewards are given at each brocken brick
