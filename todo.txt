	Todo later/maybe:
		- Policy random eps slope should be computed authomatically
		- Continue training for another 1000000 frames

Features:

		- Write GA for some solvable problem
		- Create a Model interface for GA with metrics and custom training
		- Check that everything works on the simpler problem
		- Add flloat to dependecy files
		- Add fluents to regions
	Todo later/maybe:
		- self._saved_v shouldn't be saved.
			This causes an error when resuming with a different batch.
