Things TODO:

>Agent:
- Prepare tools to stream frames
- Retrain on the server and see if it works

>Features:
- predict function to how the features work
- collect training samples during reinforcement learning
- Batch, instance normalization?
- improve initizazion

Things done:
- Simple autoencoder
- Crop the game board to the relevant part
- Tensorforce for DQN
- Trained features and agent on server
- Player.play()
- Decaying exploration rate

Notes:
- In breakout, rewards are given at each brocken brick
