>Agent:
- Player.play() to see how the agent behaves
- Is the return working?
- Streaming or saved frames

>Features:
- predict function to how the features work
- collect training samples during reinforcement learning
- Batch, instance normalization?
- improve initizazion

Things done:
- Simple autoencoder
- Focus on a part of the image
- Tensorforce for dqn
- Trained features and agent on server
