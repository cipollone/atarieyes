Things TODO:

>Agent:
- Debug bad training: the agent is not exploring
	- Look at the rewards. Are they alaways 0?
	- Stream environment frames to check training and
		to record

>Features:
- predict function to how the features work
- collect training samples during reinforcement learning
- Batch, instance normalization?
- improve initizazion

Things done:
- Simple autoencoder
- Focus on a part of the image
- Tensorforce for dqn
- Trained features and agent on server
