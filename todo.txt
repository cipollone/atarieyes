Things TODO:

- Saver and logger are just for features
- Fix agent loading
- Flake8
- Check locked and add pipfile.lock
- Try without batch

>Agent:
- Train an agent on breakout

>Features:
- predict function to how the features work
- Batch, instance normalization?
- improve initizazion

Things done:
- Simple autoencoder
- Crop the game board to the relevant part
- Tensorforce for DQN
- Trained features and agent on server
- Player.play()
- Decaying exploration rate
- collect training samples during reinforcement learning

Notes:
- In breakout, rewards are given at each brocken brick
